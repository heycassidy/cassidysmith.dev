While on a visit to Zürich, Switzerland, my sister took us on a walk along the Limmat river. The Kornhausbrücke (a road bridge) had these fantastic arched cutouts for the pedestrian paths on each side of the river. The bridge is wide enough that walking through the archway felt a bit like entering a portal with some uncertainty about what you’ll find on the other side.
