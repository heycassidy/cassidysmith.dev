If you've spent some time in Astro, you're probably familiar with the `<slot />` feature which you can use to render child components inside a wrapper component. In this post, we‚Äôll explore a way to modify Astro slot children from inside the wrapper component.

## Astro Slot Basics

You can learn all about Astro slots in the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/#slots), but for this post, we‚Äôll start with a basic example which we‚Äôll build upon later.

Let‚Äôs say we want to build an FAQ section with some custom styles and behavior using the HTML `<details>` element. We might want one component for the FAQ section and one component for the individual FAQ items that go inside the section.

First, we‚Äôve got an Astro component for the FAQ section where we‚Äôll insert our frequently asked questions via the `<slot />`.

```astro title="FAQSection.astro"
<section>
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <slot />
</section>
```

Next, we‚Äôve got an Astro component for each individual FAQ item. This component uses the HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` elements together to enable each answer to expand and collapse.

```astro title="FAQItem.astro"
---
const { question, answer } = Astro.props
---

<details>
  <summary>{question}</summary>
  {answer}
</details>
```

Putting those two components together on our Astro page, we insert the `FAQItem` components between the opening and closing tags of our `FAQSection`.

```astro title="strawberries.astro"
---
import FAQSection from '@components/FAQSection.astro'
import FAQItem from '@compoents/FAQItem.astro'
---

<FAQSection>
  <FAQItem
    question="How many strawberries do you have?"
    answer="I have five strawberries :)"
  />
  <FAQItem
    question="Would you give me a strawberry, please?"
    answer="Yes, you may have three :)"
  />
</FAQSection>
```

In the final rendered HTML shown below, the `<slot />` placeholder inside the `FAQSection` component gets replaced with the rendered HTML of our `FAQItem` children components:

```html
<section>
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>How many strawberries do you have?</summary>
    I have five strawberries :)
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Would you give me a strawberry, please?</summary>
    Yes, you may have three :)
  </details>
</section>
```

This would display on the page as something like this:

<FAQSectionBasic>
  <FAQItem
    question="How many strawberries do you have?"
    answer="I have five strawberries :)"
  />
  <FAQItem
    question="Would you give me a strawberry, please?"
    answer="Yes, you may have three :)"
  />
</FAQSectionBasic>
(I‚Äôve added some additional styles, not shown.)

Astro slots are very useful!

## Limitations of Astro Slots

This is all pretty standard stuff for Astro and other web frameworks like React, Svelte, etc., but one of the limitations of Astro slots as compared to React children is there is no built-in way to modify children passed in via the `<slot />`. Suppose we want to set an attribute on certain children, or style odd-numbered items a little differently. By default, we can't do that because Astro doesn‚Äôt give us access to pre-rendered slots content.

## Modify Astro Slot Contents

Even though we don‚Äôt get a nice `children` array in Astro like we do in other frameworks, Astro does have a `slots` property on the `Astro` global with a `render` function that allows us to grab the rendered HTML of the `<slot />` contents. Combined with Astro‚Äôs `set:html` template directive on an Astro `<Fragment />`, and an HTML parser library, we should have enough tools to achieve our goals.

Here are the steps we‚Äôll take:

1. Grab the slot HTML contents using `Astro.slots.render()`
2. Parse the HTML into a DOM tree using a parser like [linkedom](https://github.com/WebReflection/linkedom)
3. Iterate over our slot children via the DOM tree and process however we want
4. Render the modified slot children using `<Fragment set:html={modifiedSlotHTML}/>`

### Grab The Astro Slot Contents

To get the HTML of the slot contents, we‚Äôll use `Astro.slots.render('default')`. We‚Äôll await the render function and assign it to a variable in the component script <AsideNoteRef id="component-script" refLabel="1" /> part of our Astro component.

<AsideNote id="component-script" refLabel="1">
  The component script is everything between the code fences ( `---` ) in an
  Astro component. The component script runs on the server in SSR mode or during
  the build process in SSG mode, but never runs in the browser.
</AsideNote>

```astro title="FAQSection.astro" ins={1-3}
---
const html = await Astro.slots.render('default')
---

<section>
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <slot />
</section>
```

### Parse HTML

To parse HTML, we‚Äôll need to install an HTML parser. I found [linkedom](https://github.com/WebReflection/linkedom) to work pretty well for this, but there are several other options available if you don‚Äôt want to write your own HTML parser.

```
npm install -D linkedom
```

As shown below:

1. First, import `parseHTML` from the linkedom package
2. Then we destructure the parsed HTML document into `document` from `parseHTML(html)`
3. Finally, assign the HTMLCollection `document.children` to a `children` variable

```astro title="FAQSection.astro" ins={"1.":2} ins={"2.":5} ins={"3.":6}
---
import { parseHTML } from 'linkedom'

const html = await Astro.slots.render('default')
const { document } = parseHTML(html)
const children = document.children
---

<section>
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <slot />
</section>
```

### Modify Slot HTML

Now we have have an array of children HTML elements that were passed into the `<slot />` of the `FAQSection` component. We can do almost anything we'd normally do to HTML elements.

There are a few important things to get clear:

- `children` consists of HTML elements, not Astro components. This means you cannot pass props to the children and access them via the child component `Astro.props`. Unfortunate!
- DOM manipulation on `children` is implemented by our HTML parser (linkedom in this case), not the browser. Remember, everything between the code fences ( `---` ) in Astro runs on the server or build process, not in the browser. HTML parsers like linkedom may or may not implement all the DOM manipulation methods you‚Äôre used to using in the browser.

So how should we modify our FAQ section slot children? One common pattern for FAQs is to have the first one expanded by default. Since we‚Äôre expecting our children to be `FAQItem` components <AsideNoteRef id="enforce-children-type" refLabel="2" /> which render a `<details>` element, we can add the `open` attribute to the first slot child.

<AsideNote id="enforce-children-type" refLabel="2">
  If ‚Äúexpecting‚Äù a specific component type as children is too
  vibes-driven-development for you, you can iterate through each child and throw
  an error if any of them are not a `details` element! Or maybe utilize
  TypeScript here.
</AsideNote>

```astro title="FAQSection.astro" ins={8}
---
import { parseHTML } from 'linkedom'

const html = await Astro.slots.render('default')
const { document } = parseHTML(html)
const children = document.children

children[0].setAttribute('open', '')
---

<section>
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <slot />
</section>
```

### Render Modified Slot Contents

Finally, we need to replace the `<slot />` placeholder with a `<Fragment>` and set the HTML of the fragment to our modified document using Astro‚Äôs `set:html` client directive.

```astro title="FAQSection.astro" del={13} ins={14}
---
import { parseHTML } from 'linkedom'

const html = await Astro.slots.render('default')
const { document } = parseHTML(html)
const children = document.children

children[0].setAttribute('open', '')
---

<section>
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <slot />
  <Fragment set:html={document} />
</section>
```

And here‚Äôs the result! Notice the first FAQ is open by default, which is exactly what we wanted.

<FAQSectionHTMLParser>
  <FAQItem
    question="How many strawberries do you have?"
    answer="I have five strawberries :)"
  />
  <FAQItem
    question="Would you give me a strawberry, please?"
    answer="Yes, you may have three :)"
  />
</FAQSectionHTMLParser>

## Let‚Äôs Wrap Up

Thanks for reading! In summary, you can modify astro slot contents, but it comes with some pretty big caveats:

1. You need to use a third-party HTML parser (or implement your own üòé).
2. You can‚Äôt pass props to slot children which are Astro components. I know, bummer! <AsideNoteRef id="astro-children-props" refLabel="3" />

<AsideNote id="astro-children-props" refLabel="3">
  Well you sort of can, but you have to pass the children in as functions that
  return a component. See [Astro‚Äôs docs on the slot render()
  function](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#astroslotsrender)
  for more details.
