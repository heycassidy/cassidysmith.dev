    <h1>Hello!</h1><p>
      Welcome to my home page =) Iâ€™m Cassidy as you probably guessed. This site
      is under construction ðŸš§ Iâ€™m a front-end engineer and UI designer
      full-time at <a
        href="https://nobledesktop.com"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Noble Desktop</a
      >. I enjoy creative and intentional problem solving with code. Day-to-day
      I work in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript/ES6, Next.js, React, CSS, and HTML,
      but I love to explore new frameworks, languages, and tools.
